            <h1>What does "Danae" Mean?</h1>

            Hello, my name is <b><i>"Princess Danae D. Silawan"</i></b>; it's quite a mouthful, 
            isn't it? Well, you can just call me "Danae".But this introduction 
            got me thinking, "Why is my name that?", So I once asked the ones 
            who gave it to me in the first place, my parents. They said I was 
            named after the ship my father was boarding as a seaman 
            while my mother was pregnant with me. Now, their response 
            lead to even more questions like <i>"Why'd they name their 
            baby after a boat?"</i> or <i>"If I'm named after a boat, then 
            who named it and why?"</i>. All this newfound curiosity 
            made me want to do a bit of research. I pulled out the 
            encyclopedia from our classroom's mini-library since I didn't 
            have any data that day and I was at school. 
            I opened up the book and wiped out the dust it collected 
            over time just to see that I picked up Volume 1 of the 
            encyclopedia series that only features terms that start with 
            the letter A. After multiple trial-and-errors to get the 
            book I'm looking for, I finally found it and it says:
